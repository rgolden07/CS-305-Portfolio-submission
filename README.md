# CS-305-Portfolio-submission

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client is an online financial advisor and they were in search of an assessment of their web based software application and its shortcoming in reference to security.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?\
I dont know what I did well to be honest.  Its important for many reasons, but mainly to mitagate the chance of an intruder.  It adds confindence to the company in that data is safe with them. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Finding the documentation  on the classes was rather difficult at times, and once found how to implament them correcly.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
You made us implament a SSL proticol, and probably the same thing.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
OWASP dependency checker, and most of the time the rubric said that we didnt need to fix the code just run the dependency checker. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Microsoft word is a great resource because we did way more typing and conversing rather than coding.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Absolutely nothing.  They would be able to see that occasionally I have the ability to express myself in a clear and consise manner, but it would speak very little on my actual coding skills.
